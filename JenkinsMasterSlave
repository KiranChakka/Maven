Jenkins Master-Slave Configuration

Slave Node Configuration for Jenkins

Connect to Slave node through ssh
java -version
verify and if not present add jenkins user
adduser jenkins [useradd jenkins and set password]
Make sure /home/jenkins directory is present
visudo and add the line as in braces [jenkins ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL]
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config and modify the value as 'yes' for PasswordAuthentication
service sshd restart

Login to Master node
java -version
verify and if not present add jenkins user
adduser jenkins [useradd jenkins and set password]
visudo and add the line as in braces [jenkins ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL]
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config and modify the value as 'yes' for PasswordAuthentication
service sshd restart
Generate ssh keys (Private & Public) as jenkins user
su - jenkins
ssh-keygen
Navigate to the folder where keys are generated and check if the rsa keys are present.
cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
Copy the Public key to the slave machine
ssh-copy-id jenkins@52.15.40.24 [ssh-copy-id username@SlaveHostIP ]

ssh-copy-id jenkins@3.16.89.190
